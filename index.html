    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Visual text generation and text image preprocessing are two fundamental areas that play crucial roles in modern visual text analysis systems and directly impact the performance of downstream tasks such as OCR, information extraction, and visual text understanding.
      Visual text generation addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity by creating diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets [1, 2]. This not only reduces the cost and time of manual data collection but also enables the creation of comprehensive training sets that cover various visual text types and edge cases [3, 4]. Text image preprocessing [5], serving as the foundation of reliable visual text analysis pipelines, tackles real-world challenges such as low resolution [6, 7], uneven illumination [8, 9], and geometric distortions [10, 11]. These techniques are essential for handling various visual text conditions, from documents to scene images.
      The synergy of these topics to visual text analysis is becoming increasingly important: visual text generation techniques help create better training data, while advanced text image preprocessing techniques improve text quality in real conditions, facilitating model recognition. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to work on these two topics and foster innovations in visual text analysis.
      <!-- This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on 3D computer vision and graphics for eCommerce, with a focus on the three topics: 
      (1) 3D shape/scene understanding and generation e.g. semantic segmentation, affordance and motion, multi-view reconstruction; 
      (2) Digital human and fashion e.g. virtual try-ons and personalized fashion recommendation;
      (3) Foundation-model-assisted reasoning e.g. shape/scene synthesis from texts, language grounding in 3D models and diffusion-based 3D generative models. We successfully hosted the <a href="/iccv2023/">the first 3DV in eCommerce workshop at ICCV 2023</a> which was very well-received and inspiring to the audience. In this second workshop, we are inviting a fully new line of speakers including 3 keynote presentations from academia and 3 talks from industry experts.  -->
     <!--This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on generative models of 3D shapes and scenes with researchers and practitioners who use these generative models in a variety of research areas. For our purposes, we define "generative model" to include methods that synthesize geometry unconditionally as well as from sensory inputs (e.g. images), language, or other high-level specifications. Vision tasks that can benefit from such models include scene classification and segmentation, 3D reconstruction, human activity recognition, robotic visual navigation, question answering, and more.-->
